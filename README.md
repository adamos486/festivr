## Festivr by Adam Cobb

Festivr is an image loading example project featuring a customizable LruCache. 
You'll find the following paradigms in this sample project as well:
- Factory
- Builder
- ViewHolder
- Behavioral testing practices

Download this project, import it into Android studio, compile it, and run the tests in LruCacheTest.java
Run it on an Android device to profile memory usage, and view image cache handling while scrolling.

# NOTE:
- You'll probably need to modify the local.properties file.

## Running the Robolectric Test

To run Robolectric tests open Studio's "Build Variants" pane and change the "Test Artifact" to "Unit Tests". You can then run Robolectric tests using the JUnit test runner.
